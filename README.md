# LeafLens - AI Plant Doctor

LeafLens is a cross-platform Flutter application that leverages AI to diagnose plant diseases from leaf images, provides actionable care recommendations, and offers a smart chatbot for plant care advice. The app is designed for plant enthusiasts, gardeners, and farmers to help maintain plant health and prevent disease spread.

## ðŸš€ Finished Project Goal
- **End Goal:** A user-friendly mobile app that allows users to scan plant leaves, receive instant AI-powered disease diagnosis, get care/remedy suggestions, set plant care reminders, and chat with an AI plant expertâ€”all with multilingual support.
- **Current Condition:**
  - Fully functional core features: leaf scanning, AI diagnosis, chatbot, reminders, and localization.
  - Modular, extensible codebase ready for new plant species, diseases, and languages.
  - Uses simulated AI for diagnosis and chat (can be upgraded to real models/APIs).

## ðŸ“Š Current Situation & Roadmap to Completion

### Current Situation
- The application is **feature-complete for a demo/MVP**: users can scan leaves, get simulated AI diagnosis, chat with an AI plant expert, set reminders, and use the app in three languages.
- **Diagnosis and chatbot currently use simulated or API-based responses** for demonstration; real on-device ML models and more advanced AI integration are planned.
- The codebase is **modular and well-structured**, making it easy to add new features, plant species, diseases, or languages.
- **UI/UX is modern and responsive**, but can be further polished and tested on more devices.
- **No cloud sync or user accounts** yet; all data is local.
